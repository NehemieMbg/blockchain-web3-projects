# **Web3**

Web3, also known as Web 3.0, is the next evolution of the internet that is being built on top of blockchain technology. It is a decentralized network that allows for peer-to-peer transactions and other decentralized features through the use of smart contracts.

## **Key differences from Web2**

- In Web2, user data is typically controlled and stored by centralized companies and organizations. In contrast, Web3 allows users to have more control and ownership over their data through the use of decentralized systems and blockchain technology.
- Another important aspect of Web3 is the emergence of decentralized applications (dApps) and decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols. These dApps and protocols run on top of blockchain networks like Ethereum, and use smart contracts to enable peer-to-peer transactions and other decentralized features.

## **Benefits**

- Increased security through the use of blockchain technology
- Greater transparency and accountability due to the decentralized nature of the network
- More control and ownership for users over their data

## **Conclusion**

Web3 represents a significant shift in how we interact with the internet and represents a move towards a more decentralized and open online ecosystem. It is still in early stages, but the potential it holds is huge and various projects are being developed on top of this technology, which will shape the future of internet and economy.
